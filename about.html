        <p class="my-story">
          I'm a multidisciplinary designer and planner with a background in
          architecture, urban and environmental planning, and a strong
          foundation in visualization, CAD, and GIS. Skilled in 3D tools like
          3Ds Max, Blender, Lumion, and Adobe Photoshop, I specialize in
          creating detailed, functional, and visually compelling designs. Now
          transitioning into
          <span class="highlight">front-end web development</span>, I'm
          expanding my skill set into the web world with a keen eye for
          usability, layout, and detail.

          <span class="new-line"
            >Since I can remember, I've been passionate about technology and
            computers. Life, however, initially led me down the path of civil
            engineering and later into architecture and planning. It was during
            my master's degree at Politecnico di Torino that my path began to
            realign with my early interests. Thanks to my tutor and life mentor,
            <a href="https://full.polito.it/people/andrea-pollio/"
              >Professor Andrea Pollio</a
            >, I was introduced to the deeper connections between technology and
            urbanism. His guidance not only shaped my academic direction but
            also reawakened a part of me that had long been waiting to
            resurface. My thesis on
            <em>Technological Ambivalence in Urban Dashboards</em> was more than
            an academic project; it was a turning point. Now, Iâ€™m committed to
            fully embracing the world of technology, aligning my career with my
            lifelong passion.</span
